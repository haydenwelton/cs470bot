# GeoDash Bot
## Starter Code replicated from PydashÂ© by Yonah Aviv
His documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/y330/Pydash/blob/main/README.md)

## Overview
Geometry Dash implementation in python with an added AI agent that learns as it goes.

## Level information
We have 6 levels, 2 of which are slightly edited version of the levels included from Aviv's repository.
The agent is able to successfully navigate the first 3 levels. Currently, for the fourth level (Aviv's first level), it fails the last 2 seconds needed to pass the level. In theory, it could pass the fourth level with our added randomness, but chances are extremely low. The agent is also able to pass the 5th level, thanks to added randomness. And so far, the agent cannot get too far in the 6th level (Aviv's second level).

## Getting Started
